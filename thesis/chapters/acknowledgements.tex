\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I could not have completed my PhD without the sponsorship of Soukendai and NICTA.

I’d also like to thank the following people for mentoring me:

Justin Zobel - You helped me secure funding to start my PhD, and introduced me to the de Bruijn graph and DNA assembly. Without your help, I may not have started a PhD. You also taught many of the professors I had in University, so I owe a lot to you transitively speaking, too.
Kathryn Holt - Thank you for spending countless hours teaching me about biology in your office. Coming from a school that taught creationism, this was mind expanding, and incredibly influential on the way I would think in general.
Tom Conway - You kicked off the succinct de Bruijn graph subfield, and took the time to help me understand your paper over several lunches.
Simon Puglisi - Thank you for introducing me to succinct data structures. I think I’ve always done my best work whenever I’m with you, whether that is writing a paper, or rolling a cigarette and having a glass of wine in Helsinki.
Kunihiko Sadakane - Thank you for helping a young student pursue his dream of doing a PhD in succinct data structures in Japan, and being patient when I spent too much time having fun in Tokyo. You have encyclopedic knowledge, and I was incredibly lucky to be your student.
Uno Takeaki - You were always able to calm my anxieties of being a 30-something PhD student, and encouraged me to enjoy writing my dissertation. Thank you for your guidance, patience, and understanding.
Martin Muggli - Thank you for being somebody I could ask questions that I really should already know the answer to, and for carrying the codebase on. Thanks as well for the real-talk. I learned a lot about myself from you.
Travis Gagie, Jouni Siren, and Christina Boucher - co-authors, incredibly smart and creative, and a pleasure to work with.
James Harland - For introducing me to research, encouraging exploration, and for being a fantastic mentor.
Rayan Chikhi, Dinghua Li, Sean Jackman, Jared Simpson, Roberto Grossi, Rajeev Raman, and Srinivasa Rao Satti - For being available to answer my questions about a field that was new to me, and for making me feel like a welcome member of our research community.
Nick Greenfield and Nava Whiteford - For hiring me as a succinct de Bruijn graph consultant!
James Hayton and Javier Grande - This dissertation has been a monkey on my back for years, but you cut through my anxieties and helped me get it done.

Of my family and friends, these people helped me immeasurably:

John Bowe - For finding out exactly how cheap Tokyo is not. Thanks for sponsoring me.
Christine Mulvey - Thank you for helping me learn to program as a kid - I remember you debugging my basic programs that I typed in from library books. And for doing my assignments in school - why didn’t you do my dissertation though!?
James and Nikolas Bowe - For the brotherly encouragement and competition. I can finally say I’m better than you both.
Christian Sea Jones - Thanks for looking after me in Tokyo, as well as laughing every time I said “I’m trying to finish my dissertation”. Do or do not, there is no try.
Ellen Chou - For being the first person I met in Tokyo, showing me the cool bars and how to do purikura, and giving me an amazing birthday present a few days after I moved there.

It was incredibly nostalgic to sit here and write this list and reflect on how grateful I am to have met each of you.
