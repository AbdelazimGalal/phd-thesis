@article{assemblathon2,
	
Abstract = {The process of generating raw genome sequence data continues to become cheaper, faster, and more accurate. However, assembly of such data into high-quality, finished genome sequences remains challenging. Many genome assembly tools are available, but they differ greatly in terms of their performance (speed, scalability, hardware requirements, acceptance of newer read technologies) and in their final output (composition of assembled sequence). More importantly, it remains largely unclear how to best assess the quality of assembled genome sequences. The Assemblathon competitions are intended to assess current state-of-the-art methods in genome assembly.},

  abstract = {The suffix tree is one of the most important data structures in string processing and comparative genomics. However, the space consumption of the suffix tree is a bottleneck in large scale applications such as genome analysis. In this article, we will overcome this obstacle. We will show how every algorithm that uses a suffix tree as data structure can systematically be replaced with an algorithm that uses an enhanced suffix array and solves the same problem in the same time complexity. The generic name enhanced suffix array stands for data structures consisting of the suffix array and additional tables. Our new algorithms are not only more space efficient than previous ones, but they are also faster and easier to implement.},
