% UW Thesis Template for LaTeX

% FOR ASSISTANCE, please send mail to rt-IST-CSmathsci@ist.uwaterloo.ca

% Effective October 2006, the University of Waterloo 
% requires electronic thesis submission. See the UW thesis regulations at
% http://www.grad.uwaterloo.ca/Thesis_Regs/thesistofc.asp.
% However, many faculties/departments also require one or more printed
% copies. This template attempts to satisfy requirements for both types of output. 
% It is based on the standard "report" document class. The "book" document 
% class can be substituted if you have a very large, multi-part thesis.

% DISCLAIMER
% To the best of our knowledge, this template satisfies the current UW requirements.
% However, it is your responsibility to assure that you have met all 
% requirements of the University and your particular department.
% Many thanks to Colin Alie for assistance in preparing this updated template.

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------

% By default, output is produced that is geared toward generating a PDF 
% version optimized for viewing on an electronic display, including 
% hyperlinks within the PDF.
 
% E.g. to process a thesis called "mythesis.tex" based on this template, run:yea

% pdflatex mythesis	-- first pass of the pdflatex processor
% bibtex mythesis	-- generates bibliography from .bib data file(s) 
% pdflatex mythesis	-- fixes cross-references, bibliographic references, etc
% pdflatex mythesis	-- fixes cross-references, bibliographic references, etc

% If you use the recommended LaTeX editor, Texmaker, you would open the mythesis.tex
% file, then click the pdflatex button. Then run BibTeX (under the Tools menu).
% Then click the pdflatex button two more times. If you have an index as well,
% you'll need to run MakeIndex from the Tools menu as well, before running pdflatex
% the last two times.

% N.B. The "pdftex" program allows graphics in the following formats to be
% included with the "\includegraphics" command: PNG, PDF, JPEG, TIFF
% Tip 1: Generate your figures and photos in the size you want them to appear
% in your thesis, rather than scaling them with \includegraphics options.
% Tip 2: Any drawings you do should be in scalable vector graphic formats:
% SVG, PNG, WMF, EPS and then converted to PNG or PDF, so they are scalable in
% the final PDF as well.
% Tip 3: Photographs should be cropped and compressed so as not to be too large.

% To create a PDF output that is optimized for double-sided printing: 
%
% 1) comment-out the \documentclass statement in the preamble below, and
% un-comment the second \documentclass line.
%
% 2) change the value assigned below to the boolean variable
% "ElectronicVersion" from "true" to "false".

% --------------------- Start of Document Preamble -----------------------

% Specify the document class, default style attributes, and page dimensions
% For hyperlinked PDF, suitable for viewing on a computer, use this:
\documentclass[letterpaper,12pt,titlepage,oneside,final]{report}
 
% For un-hyperlinked PDF, suitable for double-sided printing, use this:
%\documentclass[letterpaper,12pt,titlepage,openright,twoside,final]{report}

% Some LaTeX commands I define for my own nomenclature.
% If you have to, it's better to change nomenclature once here than in a 
% million places throughout your thesis!
\newcommand{\package}[1]{\textbf{#1}} % package names in bold text
\newcommand{\cmmd}[1]{\textbackslash\texttt{#1}} % command name in tt font 
\newcommand{\href}[1]{#1} % does nothing, but defines the command so the
    % print-optimized version will ignore \href tags (redefined by hyperref pkg).
%\newcommand{\texorpdfstring}[2]{#1} % does nothing, but defines the command
% Anything defined here may be redefined by packages added below...

% This package allows if-then-else control structures.

% Hyperlinks make it very easy to navigate an electronic document.
% The following statement places "bookmarks" in the PDF document
% linking Table of Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables, and
% List of References entries to their appearance in the body of the
% text.  In addition, this is where one would specify the thesis title
% and author as they appear in the properties of the PDF document.

% Setting up the page margins...
% UW thesis requirements specify a minimum of 1 inch (72pt) margin at the
% top, bottom, and outside page edges and a 1.125 inch (81pt) gutter
% margin (on binding side). While this is not an issue for electronic
% viewing, a PDF may be printed, and so we have the same page layout for
% both printed and electronic versions, we leave the gutter margin in.
% The standard method of setting margins is with the \setlength command.
% We have used the "geometry" package, added above, to do it in one line.
% For completeness, the appropriate \setlength commands are show here, 
% commented out.
% Set margins to minimum permitted by UW thesis regulations:
%\setlength{\marginparwidth}{0pt} % width of margin notes
% N.B. If margin notes are used, you must adjust \textwidth, \marginparwidth
% and \marginparsep so that the space left between the margin notes and page
% edge is less than 15 mm (0.6 in.)
%\setlength{\marginparsep}{0pt} % width of space between body text and margin notes
%\setlength{\evensidemargin}{0.5in} % Adds 1/8 in. to binding side of all 
% even-numbered pages when the "twoside" printing option is selected
%\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{0.5in} % Adds 1/8 in. to the left of all pages
% when "oneside" printing is selected, and to the left of all odd-numbered
% pages when "twoside" printing is selected
%\setlength{\textwidth}{6.0in} % assuming US letter paper (8.5 in. x 11 in.) and 
% side margins as above
\raggedbottom

% The following statement specifies the amount of space between
% paragraphs. Other reasonable specifications are \bigskipamount and \smallskipamount.
\setlength{\parskip}{\medskipamount}

% The following statement controls the line spacing.  The default
% spacing corresponds to good typographic conventions and only slight
% changes (e.g., perhaps "1.2"), if any, should be made.
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1} % this is the default line space setting

% By default, each chapter will start on a recto (right-hand side)
% page. We also force each section of the front pages to start on 
% a recto page by inserting \cleardoublepage commands in the 
% uw-ethesis-frontpgs.tex file, included below, with the \input command.
% In many cases, this will require that the verso page be
% blank and, while it should be counted, a page number should not be
% printed.  The following statements ensure a page number is not
% printed on an otherwise blank verso page.
\let\origdoublepage\cleardoublepage
\newcommand{\clearemptydoublepage}{%
  \clearpage{\pagestyle{empty}\origdoublepage}}
\let\cleardoublepage\clearemptydoublepage

\begin{document}

% For a large document, it is a good idea to divide your thesis
% into several files, each one containing one chapter.
% To illustrate this idea, the "front pages" (i.e., title page,
% declaration, borrowers' page, abstract, acknowledgements,
% dedication, table of contents, list of tables, list of figures,
% nomenclature) are contained within the file "uw-ethesis-frontpgs.tex" which is
% included into the document by the following statement.

% FRONT MATERIAL

% MAIN BODY
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Because this is a short document, and to reduce the number of files
% needed for this template, the chapters are not separate
% documents as suggested above, but you get the idea. If they were
% separate documents, they would each start with the \chapter command, i.e, 
% do not contain \documentclass or \begin{document} and \end{document} commands.
\input{chapters/introduction}
\input{chapters/related_work}
\input{chapters/mclwmr}
\input{chapters/closest_string}
\input{chapters/cswo}

% The following statement selects the style to use for references.  It controls the sort order of the entries in the bibliography and also the formatting for the in-text labels.
\bibliographystyle{plain}
% This specifies the location of the file containing the bibliographic information.  
% It assumes you're using BibTeX (if not, why not?).
\bibliography{uw-ethesis}
% The following statement causes the title "References" to be used for the biliography section:
\renewcommand{\bibname}{Bibliography}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\textbf{Bibliography}}
% Tip 5: You can create multiple .bib files to organize your references. 
% Just list them all in the \bibliogaphy command, separated by commas (no spaces).

% The following statement causes the specified references to be added to the bibliography% even if they were not 
% cited in the text. The asterisk is a wildcard that causes all entries in the bibliographic database to be included (optional).
\nocite{*}
