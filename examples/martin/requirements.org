* MOTIVATION for pursuing the research
** Colored de Bruijn graph method is powerful
** Would like to make it available for "realtime" screening
*** but is too slow to construct
** genomes vary in a variety of ways
** these variations are used like a fingerprint to track source
** would like to enable complex variants

** dearth of tools for complex variants that scale

** there may be a chicken-and-egg problem: nobody has looked at statistical techniques based on complex variants because there are no/few tools to deliver them

** discover techniques useful for GCSA and XBW

** establish (through citation) that complex variants happen and CDBG can find them, and that there is a high likelihood they would be useful.
*** poke holes in reference based methods https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-S4-S10

* precise STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM to be solved,
** validate method against CORTEX
** demonstrate scalability/performance on GenomeTrakr
** compare bubble based calls with k-mer based correlation with the limited metadata

* reflect an extensive critical LITERATURE SURVEY, and contain an accurate assessment of the state-of-the-art in the area of research,

* evidence to the effect that there is a good likelihood the PROBLEM IS SOLVABLE with reasonable effort.
** preliminary results
** why my publications?
*** proves technology can do it
**** convince the reader it will work by applying to reasoning about the underlying method
*** demonstrate that I have the skills and moderates the reasonable effort claim
