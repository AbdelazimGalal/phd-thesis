1. protein interactions are important
2. computational methods for protein interaction prediction are important
3. existing methods are not partner-specific
4. partner specific methods can perform better due to these theoretical reasons
5. we have tested partner-specific method for CaM interaction prediction and seen better results
6. We have also developed a more generic predictor and here are its preliminary results
7. we propose to improve this predictor using these new features


1. genomics is important
2. computation methods for assembly and comparison of genomics are important
3. existing methods are fairly direct
4. succinct can perform better because there is redundancy and solutions need not visit every item
5. we have tested succinct data structures on optical mapping and seen better speed and quality of results
6. we have also applied it to smaller population colored dbg and seen smaller footprint
7. we propose to augment VARI with these features and compare with existing methods
