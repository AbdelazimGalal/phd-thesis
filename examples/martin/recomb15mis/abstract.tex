A crucial problem in genome assembly is the discovery and correction of misassembly errors in draft genomes.  
%A large number of these errors can occur in draft genomes and add to the cost and time associated with many scientific initiatives, including Genome 10K, the iK5 project, and 1001 Genomes.  
We develop a method that will enhance the quality of draft genomes by identifying and removing misassembly errors using paired short read sequence data and optical mapping data.  
We apply our method to various assemblies of the loblolly pine and {\em Francisella tularensis} genomes.  
Our results demonstrate that we detect more than 54\% of extensively misassembled contigs and more than 60\% of locally misassembed contigs in an assembly of {\em Francisella tularensis}, and between 31\% and 100\% of extensively misassembled contigs and between 57\% and 73 \% of locally misassembed contigs in the assemblies of loblolly pine.
