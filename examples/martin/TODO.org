* TODO KEY AREAS
** Specific

** novel
*** TODO strain typing related work
*** TODO colored de Bruijn graph editing related work


** important (motivation)
*** VARI paper said it's too big because of space
*** Can only handle the number of allowed file handles
*** It is wasteful to repeat work when we only need to add a few colors
*** Doing sort in memory is likely faster
*** motivations for cdbg:
**** no such things as species (reference based)
***** large insertions missed
**** no core genome

** viable (preliminary results (see VARI))
*** TODO include details from salmonella from past emails and Ipython notebook about core genome
*** progress
**** downloaded, assembled, k-mers counted
**** one possible method already developed
